## Source-to-Image (S2I) Framework

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/creating_images/s2i.html

Creating S2I images out of scope in this workshop.

---

## S2I workflow

S2I images are used in Openshift for `Build`s with --strategy=source.

The goal is to produce an image that runs the application.

Builder Image + S2I Scripts + User supplied source => Image

---

## Let's see it work

`oc new-build --binary registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7 --name=static-site` results in a S2I build.

`oc start-build static-site --from-dir=.` uploads directory `.` as S2I context.

---

## What happened (very simplified!)

1. registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7 is a S2I ready image. https://github.com/sclorg/httpd-container

2. We defined a openshift new-build that uses this S2I image. The S2I Image has already all the scripts baked in.

3. During the build (S2I assemble script), the user supplied source (`--from-dir=.`) is copied to `/opt/app-root/src`

4. The Apache configuration is (`/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`) is modified (mainly DocumentRoot is set to `/opt/app-root/src`)

5. The finished image is pushed into the internal Openshift registry /NAMESPACE/static-site:latest

6. (Deployments will be triggered, if they were pointing to the image)

7. (During deployment, the S2I run script will be run)
